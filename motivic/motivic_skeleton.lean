# Motivic Obstructions Skeleton

We define counting of F_q-points on varieties given by Permanent=gamma and Det=delta
and use differences as motivic obstructions.

variable (n q : ℕ)

/-- Affine variety of zeros of F1 = Perm_n - gamma over F_q. -/
def PermVariety : Type := (Fin q) → (Fin (n^2+1)) → Prop

/-- Counts points on a variety over F_q. -/
def count_points (V : Type) : ℕ := 0 -- TODO: actual counting

/-- Motivic obstruction: difference in point counts grows exponentially. -/
theorem perm_points_gt_det (n q : ℕ) :
  count_points (PermVariety n q) > count_points (DetVariety n q) := by
  -- Sketch: empirical for small q,n, and theoretical extension via motivic integration
