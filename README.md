# Hybrid Obstructions for P ≠ NP

This repository presents a hybrid, cross-disciplinary framework that explores new approaches to the **P vs NP problem**, combining tools from:

- Algebraic geometry (orbit closures, GCT)
- Shifted Partial Derivatives (SPD)
- Sum-of-Squares (SoS) proof systems
- Gowers Uniformity Norms
- Tropical Geometry
- Motivic Point Counts
- Hodge Theory
- Categorical Obstructions (K-Theory)
- Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT)

## Who Am I?

I'm a developer and mathematics enthusiast, not a professional mathematician.  
This repository is a **creative exploration**, and a call for collaboration.  
I believe the ideas here may offer fresh angles worth formal attention.

## Call for Collaboration

If you're a:

- Theorist curious about alternative invariants
- Formalist (e.g., Lean/Coq) who wants to help formalize
- Quantum or topological researcher intrigued by the crossover
- Student who wants a bold idea to explore…

**You're invited to contribute, comment, or just reach out!**

## Status

This is a prototype / draft repository. Many ideas are sketched, not proven.  
But they are *connected*, and meant to provoke progress.  
See the `gct_obstructions.tex` file for the full writeup.
